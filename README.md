Questions:
    1. Should I have both players trying to guess the same word or should I have them each have the same word and pit them against each other to see who can guess it first and who has the most points?

    2. If they are guessing the same word it should probably be turn based.

    3. If they are guessing the same word should I show the same list of missed guesses to both players or should I have each of them have their own list of missed guesses that the other player cannot see so they cannot use their opponents missed guesses to aid them in guessing correctly?

    4.
